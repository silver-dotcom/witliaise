# Witiliaise

Witliaise is a Flutter-based Android application that brings in students and teachers under one roof by providing them a secure and
convenient platform to communicate with each other. Since it is an academic platform, there
is no overshadowing of important messages. Teachers and students can view the academic
calendar which keeps them informed about upcoming events. The forum feature in the app
encourages open discussions amongst the users and the cloud feature allows both users to
upload files related to academics and store it in the cloud.
